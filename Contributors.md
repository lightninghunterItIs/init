It’s that time of year again! Whether your October is full of pumpkins or spring breezes (hello, Southern Hemisphere!), it’s sure to be Hacktoberfest season. Hacktoberfest is a yearly event to encourage people to contribute to open source in October. It’s a celebration of community, learning and giving back—topped off by DigitalOcean thanking participants. You can read more about the festivities—and the thank yous—on the official site.

In the past year, we’ve seen over 2.2 billion contributions to projects on GitHub from more than 65 million developers. Giving back to open source projects by contributing can be a great way to learn, practice skills you don’t currently get to use in your day job, and meet new people by working together on projects that you enjoy using.
